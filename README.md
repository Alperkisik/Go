# The-Go-Game

This is a standart multiplayer go game made as high-school graduation project and this is a 3 people teamwork project. 
I designed and coded all back-end codes,game rules etc others designed database and user interface.

Note : It is made by an old visual studio version at 2012 and database was sqlCe so you can face some problems if you want to run this project. SqlCe is not supportted now.
